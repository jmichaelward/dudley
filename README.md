# Description
In the agency world, we tend to recreate the same types of modular components over and 
over between projects - image carousels, FAQ accordions, huge hero areas with 
headlines and calls to actions - the list goes on.

This plugin serves as a framework for quickly integrating existing 
development patterns into client projects. It enables developers to pull
in JSON files that define data structures in Advanced Custom Fields, and 
combine it with a data model and markup to quickly scaffold out new page 
templates.

For now, this repo contains only the development framework - there are no
sample modules, markup, or ACF data structures. In time, 3five will integrate
the ability for developers to define which modules to import into a project 
via a composer.json file, and provide tools for importing base CSS and 
JavaScript the modules need in order to render and function.
